# Tools to generate stats and decision trees from game records

(TODO)

## [dump_game_stats](tools/dump_game_stats/)

This tool analyzes game logs in mjai format, including gzip-compressed files, and generates overall game statistics such as number of wins, tsumo rate, draw ratio, average winning points, and tenpai timing distributions.

## [dump_light_game_stats](tools/dump_light_game_stats/)

This tool analyzes game logs in mjai format, including gzip-compressed files, and generates per-round statistics on score differentials.

## [postprocess_light_game_stats](tools/postprocess_light_game_stats/)

This tool transforms score differentials generated by `dump_light_game_stats` into win probabilities.
