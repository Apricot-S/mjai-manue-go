# mjai-manue-go

[![Ask DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com/badge.svg)](https://deepwiki.com/Apricot-S/mjai-manue-go)

Go port of [mjai-manue](https://github.com/gimite/mjai-manue) â€” a Mahjong AI for the [Mjai Mahjong AI match server](https://gimite.net/pukiwiki/index.php?Mjai%20%E9%BA%BB%E9%9B%80AI%E5%AF%BE%E6%88%A6%E3%82%B5%E3%83%BC%E3%83%90)

## Differences from Original

### Protocol Support Extensions

- In addition to [Gimite's original Mjai protocol](https://gimite.net/pukiwiki/index.php?Mjai%20%E9%BA%BB%E9%9B%80AI%E5%AF%BE%E6%88%A6%E3%82%B5%E3%83%BC%E3%83%90), also supports [a minor modified version of the Mjai protocol used by RiichiLab](https://mjai.app/docs/mjai-protocol).

### Architecture Improvements

- Embed configuration files at build time instead of loading them at runtime.
- Fixed an incorrect shanten number calculation when a hand contains four identical tiles.
- Log more detailed information about the game state.
- Improved error handling to more reliably reject invalid or anomalous input.
- Refactored the code for better readability and maintainability.

### Target Version

> [!NOTE]
> The original project includes an older version written in Ruby and a newer version written in CoffeeScript. This project ports only the new version.

## How It Works

(TODO)

The discard that minimizes this avgRank is selected.

Decisions such as "whether to call or not" and "whether to declare Riichi or not" are also made in a similar method.

## Installation

Requires [Go 1.24 or later](https://go.dev/dl/).

```sh
go install github.com/Apricot-S/mjai-manue-go/cmd/mjai-manue@latest
```

## Usage

### For TCP/IP (e.g., [mjai](https://github.com/gimite/mjai))

```sh
mjai-manue mjsonp://example.com:11600/default
```

### For Standard I/O (e.g., [mjai.app](https://github.com/smly/mjai.app))

```sh
mjai-manue
```

> [!NOTE]
> In practice, `mjai.app` runs `bot.py` in the submission `.zip` file.
> You need to call the above command from within `bot.py` and pipe the standard input and output.

> [!TIP]
> See [scripts/mjai.app/](scripts/mjai.app/) for how to generate a submission file for `mjai.app`.

> [!TIP]
> To customize the AI's strategic behavior, replace the following configuration files before building `mjai-manue`:
>
> - `configs/danger_tree.all.json`
> - `configs/game_stats.json`
> - `configs/light_game_stats.json`
>
> See [tools/](tools/) for instructions on how to generate these files.
