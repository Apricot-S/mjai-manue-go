# Original-vs-Port Testing Framework

A test framework for comparing the behavior of mjai-manue's original implementation and the Go port.

## gen_log

Docker Compose configuration and related scripts for generating game logs. It runs one instance of the original mjai-manue against three existing mjai clients ([Akochan](https://github.com/critter-mj/akochan)) on the mjai platform, playing games and generating game logs.

### Services

- server  
  - The mjai server.
  - Manages game progression and outputs logs to the specified directory.
- manue  
  - The original mjai-manue (1 instance).
  - Connects to the server to play matches.
- akochan1 / akochan2 / akochan3  
  - Existing mjai clients (3 instances) used as opponents.
  - Connect to the server to play matches.

### Log Output

- After each game, the server outputs a game log in mjson (JSON Lines) format.
- Logs are saved under the specified directory.
- Filenames are timestamp-based (e.g., `2025-08-14-163231.mjson`).

### Usage

With `test/original_vs_port/gen_log/` as the current directory, run the following command:

```sh
NUM_GAMES=<NUMBER_OF_GAMES> docker compose up
```

- `NUM_GAMES`  
  The number of games to run (default: `1`).
- `LOG_DIR`  
  The directory to save logs (default: `test/original_vs_port/log_dir`).

## compare

A Go program that checks for differences in decision-making between the original mjai-manue and the port. Reads game logs and compares their actions at each decision-making point. When differences are found, outputs a report showing the game state and chosen action.

### Input

- mjson format game logs that contain **exactly one** player of the original mjai-manue.
- The original mjai-manue is identified by the player name `Manue014`.
- Intended to use files generated by `gen_log`, but any game log meeting this condition can be used.

### Output

Outputs the differences as a report (text format) to standard output.

### Usage

With the top-level directory of working tree of this repository as the current directory, run the following command:

```sh
go run ./test/original_vs_port/compare <LOG_GLOB_PATTERNS>... > <OUTPUT_FILEPATH> 2>/dev/null
```

Errors are printed at the end of standard output.

The Go port log is output to standard error output. There is no need to check this as it is not relevant to comparing differences.

- `<LOG_GLOB_PATTERNS>`  
  Log file patterns to compare (e.g., `./test/original_vs_port/log_dir/*.mjson`).
